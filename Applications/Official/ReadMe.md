# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for Official firmware

## FAP FILES REMOVED - Use [FlipC.org](https://flipc.org/) or the Official FAP Store within the mobile app!

See the [official documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md)

*** **Unofficial FAP Store is here! [You gotta check it out at FlipC.org](https://flipc.org/)** ***<br>
From [Aleksey Korolev](https://github.com/playmean) comes a quick and easy way to install FAP files.

A humble thank you to [Alexei Humeniy](https://github.com/ahumeniy) for previously maintaining the FAPs for Official firmware!<br>
Missing or outdated FAPs may be found from [kyhwana](https://github.com/kyhwana/latest_flipper_zero_apps) or [grnch](https://github.com/grinchdubs/latest_flipper_zero_apps), plus [Aleksandr Zhytnyk](https://github.com/OperKH) has also contributed a number of updates.

**NOTE: Some apps which use audio won't work due to a new pattern for audio access.** ([More info](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/pull/257))
