# Make your own animations!

So you want to make your own animations? Thankfully, TalkingSasquach has [an excellent write-up](https://github.com/skizzophrenic/Talking-Sasquach) on how to.

Are you more the type that just wants to grab some pre-made and tinker with how they work?<br>
- Then you'll want to check out [Kuronons's repo](https://github.com/Kuronons/FZ_graphics)!
- If you like beards, run your fingers though [Talking Sasquach's repo](https://github.com/skizzophrenic/Talking-Sasquach).

# Some other graphics fun
Head into the dolphin folder and you'll see a bunch of other folders. The names should roughly correspond with the animation. Inside of THAT folder you'll see a meta.txt file. Save a copy to your system to edit it (or go directly through the mobile device web browser). If the animation has speech bubbles, you can find and edit the text in here! Save it and reboot the Flipper to see it. If it's not coming up fast enough, edit the manifest.txt file in the root and increase the weight, then reboot again.

Also in the manifest.txt file will be a min.max `butthurt` value, and a max level.<br>
Play around with these to find what suits you best! If needed, you can also up your [Dolphin level](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Dolphin_Level)!<br>
